- Dynamic Programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions using a memory-based data structure
- Dynamic Programming is just a fancy way to say 'remembering stuff to save time later'
- simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner.
- Dynamic programming approach is similar to divide and conquer in breaking down the problem into smaller and yet smaller possible sub-problems. 
- But unlike, divide and conquer, these sub-problems are not solved independently. Rather, results of these smaller sub-problems are remembered and used for similar or overlapping sub-problems.
