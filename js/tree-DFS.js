/*
DFS

Create a variable to store the values of nodes visited
Store the root of the BST in a variable called current
Write a helper function which accepts a node
If the node has a left property, call the helper function with the left property on the node
Push the value of the node to the variable that stores the values
If the node has a right property, call the helper function with the right property on the node
Invoke the helper function with the current variable
Return the array of values
