 * DescriptionSolutionNotesDiscussLeaderboard Description Given an list
 * interval, which are taking off and landing time of the flight. How many
 * airplanes are there at most at the same time in the sky?
 * 
 * If landing and taking off of different planes happen at the same time, we
 * consider landing should happen at first.
 * 
 * Example Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: [(1, 10), (2, 3), (5, 8), (4, 7)] Output: 3 Explanation: The first
 * airplane takes off at 1 and lands at 10. The second airplane takes off at 2
 * and lands at 3. The third airplane takes off at 5 and lands at 8. The forth
 * airplane takes off at 4 and lands at 7. During 5 to 6, there are three
 * airplanes in the sky. Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)] Output: 1 Explanation: Landing happen before
 * taking off.
