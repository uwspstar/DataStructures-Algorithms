### NOTES
- backward loop : ```for num in nums[::-1]```
- ```count++``` NOT working , need to use ```count +=1```

### Data Structures
- https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html
- https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/python/data_structures.html
- The builtin data structures are: ```lists```, ```tuples```, ```dictionaries```, ```strings```, ```sets``` and ```frozensets```.

- Lists, strings and tuples are ordered sequences of objects. 
- Unlike strings that contain only characters, list and tuples can contain any type of objects. 
- Lists and tuples are like arrays. 
- Tuples like strings are immutables. 
- Lists are mutable so they can be extended or reduced at will. 
- Sets are mutable unordered sequence of unique elements whereas frozensets are immutable sets.
