Math.log10(x) // If the number is negative, NaN is returned.

Because log10() is a static method of Math, you always use it as Math.log10(), rather than as a method of a Math object you created (Math is not a constructor)

The Math.log10() function returns the base 10 logarithm of a number

Math.log10(2);      // 0.3010299956639812
Math.log10(1);      // 0
Math.log10(0);      // -Infinity
Math.log10(-2);     // NaN
Math.log10(100000); // 5
