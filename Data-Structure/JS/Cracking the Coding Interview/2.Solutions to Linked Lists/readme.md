# Linked Lists
- Unlike an array, a linked list does not provide constant time access to a particular "index" within the list. 
- This means that if you'd like to find the Kth element in the list, you will need to iterate through K elements.
- The ```benefit``` of a linked list is that you can add and remove items from the beginning of the list in constant time. For specific applications, this can be useful.
