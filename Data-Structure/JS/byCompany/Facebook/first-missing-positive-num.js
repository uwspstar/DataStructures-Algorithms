/*
You are given an array of integers. Return the smallest positive integer that is not present in the array. The array may contain duplicate entries.

For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should return 2 because it is the smallest positive integer that doesn't exist in the array.

Your solution should run in "linear time" and use "constant space".
