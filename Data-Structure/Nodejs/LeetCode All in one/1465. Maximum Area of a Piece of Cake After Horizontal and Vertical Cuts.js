//1465. Maximum Area of a Piece of Cake After Horizontal and Vertical Cuts
/*
You are given a rectangular cake of size h x w and two arrays of integers horizontalCuts and verticalCuts where:

horizontalCuts[i] is the distance from the top of the rectangular cake to the ith horizontal cut and similarly, and
verticalCuts[j] is the distance from the left of the rectangular cake to the jth vertical cut.
Return the maximum area of a piece of cake after you cut at each horizontal and vertical position provided in the arrays horizontalCuts and verticalCuts. Since the answer can be a large number, return this modulo 109 + 7.
