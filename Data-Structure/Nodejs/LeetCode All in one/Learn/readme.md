### Arrays 101 (31) items

### Linked List (30) items

- linked list is a linear data structure
- Linked List O(N) time on average to visit an element by index
- singly linked list and doubly linked list;
- Use `two-pointer technique` (fast-pointer-slow-pointer technique) in the linked list;
- `reverse a linked list`

- Unlike the array, we are not able to access a random element in a singly-linked list in constant time. If we want to get the ith element, we have to traverse from the head node one by one. It takes us O(N) time on average to visit an element by index, where N is the length of the linked list.
