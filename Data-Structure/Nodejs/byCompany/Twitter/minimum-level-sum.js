/*
You are given the root of a binary tree. Find the level for the binary tree with the minimum sum, and return that value.

For instance, in the example below, the sums of the trees are 10, 2 + 8 = 10, and 4 + 1 + 2 = 7. So, the answer here should be 7.

#     10
#    /  \
#   2    8
#  / \    \
# 4   1    2
