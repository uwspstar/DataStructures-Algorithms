# Two Pointers

- https://hackernoon.com/14-patterns-to-ace-any-coding-interview-question-c5bb3357f6ed
- often useful when searching pairs in a sorted array or linked list

---

### Ways to identify when to use the Two Pointer method:

- It will feature problems where you deal with sorted arrays (or Linked Lists) and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints
- The set of elements in the array is a pair, a triplet, or even a subarray

---

### Some problems that feature the Two Pointer pattern:

- Squaring a sorted array (easy)
- Triplets that sum to zero (medium)
- Comparing strings that contain backspaces (medium)

---

### left and right

- palindrome Array, String

### Fast and Slow pointers

- This approach is quite useful when dealing with cyclic linked lists or arrays.
- Linked List Cycle (easy)
- Palindrome Linked List (medium)
- Cycle in a Circular Array (hard)
