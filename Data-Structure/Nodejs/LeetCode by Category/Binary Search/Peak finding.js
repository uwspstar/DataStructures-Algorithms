/*
Given a non-empty array of integers arr, create a function that returns the index of a peak element. We consider an element as peak if it's greater than or equal to its neighbors, the next and previous element (assume that arr[-1] and arr[n] are equal to -âˆž). And if there are multiple peaks in arr, just return the index of one of them.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [4, 5, 8, 3] Output: 2
Explanation: arr[2] is a peak element because it's greater than or equal to arr[1], and greater than or equal to arr[3]

Example 2:
Input: arr = [1, 3, 4, 7, 8] Output: 4
Explanation: arr[4] is a peak element because it's greater than or equal to arr[3], which is it's only neighbor

Example 3:
Input: arr = [1, 5, 2, 6, 6, 3] Output: 3
Explanation: arr[3] is a peak element because it's greater than or equal to arr[2] and greater than or equal to arr[4] (other valid outputs would be 1 and 4, because arr[1] and arr[4] are also peak elements)
