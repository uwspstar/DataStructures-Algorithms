410. Split Array Largest Sum (Hard)

Given an array nums which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m, you can split the array into m non-empty continuous subarrays.

Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays.

Example 1: Input: nums = [7,2,5,10,8], m = 2 Output: 18
Explanation:
There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8],
where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.
Example 2: Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], m = 2 Output: 9
Example 3: Input: nums = [1,4,4], m = 3 Output: 4
