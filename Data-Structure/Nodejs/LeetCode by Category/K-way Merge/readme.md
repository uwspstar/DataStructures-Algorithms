- https://hackernoon.com/14-patterns-to-ace-any-coding-interview-question-c5bb3357f6ed

- K-way Merge helps you solve problems that involve a set of sorted arrays
- Whenever you’re given ‘K’ sorted arrays, you can use a Heap to efficiently perform a sorted traversal of all the elements of all arrays.

### identify the K-way Merge pattern:

- The problem will feature sorted arrays, lists, or a matrix
- If the problem asks you to merge sorted lists, find the smallest element in a sorted list.
- Merge K Sorted Lists (medium)
- K Pairs with Largest Sums (Hard)
