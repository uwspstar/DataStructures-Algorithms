/*
Given a non-empty array of integers arr, create a function that returns the sum of the subarray that has the greatest sum.
We don't consider the empty array [] as a subarray.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [2, 3, -6, 4, 2, -8, 3] Output: 6
Explanation: the maximum subarray is [4, 2], its sum is 6

Example 2:
Input: arr = [2, 3, -1, 4, -10, 2, 5] Output: 8
Explanation: the maximum subarray is [2, 3, -1, 4], its sum is 8

Example 3:
Input: arr = [-3, -1, -2] Output: -1
Explanation: the maximum subarray is [-1], its sum is -1
