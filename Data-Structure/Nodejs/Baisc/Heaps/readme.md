- A heap is an important data structure that returns the highest or lowest element in O(1) time.
- A heap is a type of tree-like data structure in which the parent is bigger than its children (if max-heap) or smaller than its children (if min-heap).
- heap use an array to store data
- A heap node’s children’s positions (indices) in the array can be calculated easily. This is because the parent-child relationship is easily defined with a heap.
- A binary heap can be built by placing the first array element as the root and then filling each left and right element in order.
