indexOf

When comparing strings and characters, includes() is case-sensitive.const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(array1.includes(2));
// expected output: true


Values of zero are all considered to be equal, regardless of sign. (That is, -0 is considered to be equal to both 0 and +0), but false is not considered to be the same as 0.

Technically speaking, includes() uses the sameValueZero algorithm to determine whether the given element is found.
