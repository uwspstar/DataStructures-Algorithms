- Abstract Data Type (ADT)
```
An abstract data type is an abstraction of a data structure 
which provides only the interface to which a data structure mush adhere to.  
the interface does not give any specific details about 
how something should be implemented or in what programming language
```
- List ( Dynamic Array, linked List)
- Queue ( Linked List based Queue, array based Queue, Stack based Queue)
- Map  (Tree Map, Hash Map / Hash Table)

### Complexity Analysis
- time
- space

### Big-O Notation
```
Constant Time: O(1)
Logarithmic Time: O(log(n))
Liner Time: O(n)
Quadric Time: O(n^2)
Cubic Time: O(n^3)
Exponential Time: O(b^n), b>1
Factorial Time: O(n!)
```
- O(n + c) = O(n)
- O(cn) = O(n) , c >0
- f(n) = 7log(n)^3 + 15n^2+ 2n^3 + 8 // ```O(f(n)) = O(n^3)```
### When and where is a static Array Used ?
    - 1) storing and accessing sequential data
    - 2) Temporarily storing objects
    - 3) Used by IO routines as buffers
    - 4) Lookup tables and inverse lookup tables
    - 5) can be used to return multiple values from a function
    - 6) Used in dynamic programming to cache answers to subproblems
### when you use linked lists?  
    - used in many List, Queue, Stack implementations
    - Great for creating circular lists
    - Can easily model real world objects such as trains.
    - used in separate chining which is persnet certain hashtable implementations to deal with hashing collisions.
    - ofter used in the implementation of adjacency lists for graphs
### when you use stack 
    - used by undo mechanisms in text editors
    - used in comiler syntax checking for matching brackets and braces
    - can be used to model a pile of books or plates.
    - used behind the scenes to support recursion by keep track of previous function calls.
    - can be used to d a Depth First Search (DFS) on a graph
### when you use Queue
    - any waiting line models a queue, for example a lineup at a movie theatre.
    - can be used to efficiently keep track of the x most recently added elements
    - Web server request management where you want first come first serve.
    - Breadth First Search (BFS) graph traversal
### when you use PQ
    - used in certain implemetations of Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm.
    - Anytime you need the dynamically fetch the 'next best' or 'next worst' element
    - Used in Huffman coding (which is often used for lossless data compression)
    - Best First Search (BFS) algrorithms such as A use PQs to continuously grab the next most promising node.
    - Used by Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms
### Turnign Min PQ into Maz PQ
    - an alternative method for numbers is to negate the numbers as you insert them into the PQ and negate them again when they are taken out. This has the same effect as negating the comparator.
