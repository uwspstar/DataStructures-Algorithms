// 391 Â· Number of Airplanes in the Sky
/*
Given an list interval, which are taking off and landing time of the flight. How many airplanes are there at most at the same time in the sky?

Input: [(1, 10), (2, 3), (5, 8), (4, 7)]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The first airplane takes off at 1 and lands at 10.
The second airplane takes off at 2 and lands at 3.
The third airplane takes off at 5 and lands at 8.
The forth airplane takes off at 4 and lands at 7.
During 5 to 6, there are three airplanes in the sky.
