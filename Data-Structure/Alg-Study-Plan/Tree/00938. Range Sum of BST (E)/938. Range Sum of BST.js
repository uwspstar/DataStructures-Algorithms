// 938. Range Sum of BST
/*
Given the root node of a binary search tree and two integers low and high, return the sum of values of all nodes with a value in the inclusive range [low, high].

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], low = 7, high = 15
Output: 32
Explanation: Nodes 7, 10, and 15 are in the range [7, 15]. 7 + 10 + 15 = 32.
