- directed graphs
- weighted graphs

# Disjoint Set - union-find

- the “disjoint set” data structure, also known as the “union-find” data structure.
- The primary use of disjoint sets is to address the connectivity between the components of a network.
- The “network“ here can be a computer network or a social network.
- For instance, we can use a disjoint set to determine if two people share a common ancestor.
