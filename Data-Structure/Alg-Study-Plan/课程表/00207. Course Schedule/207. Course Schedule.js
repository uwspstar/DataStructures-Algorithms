// 207. Course Schedule
/*
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

Example 1:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
Example 2:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

/*
Topological Sorting (Kahn's Algorithm)

1. Fill an array inDegree[], where inDegree[i] is the number of incoming edges to node i;
i represents a course and incoming edges represent the pre-requisites.
2. Fill an adjacency list.
3. Use queue to traverse nodes in topological order.
- start with nodes that have 0 in-degree as it means they have no dependency
- when visiting a node, delete outgoing edges from the node; if this causes other nodes
to have 0 in-degree, push those nodes into queue
- repeat this until queue is empty
4. if the total number of visited nodes in topological order is equal to n, return true;
otherwise, return false. This is because, if there is no cycle in the graph, we should be able to
traverse all nodes in topological order.
