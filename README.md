- bigO (Best Case, Average Case, Worst Case)
  - speed
  - space
  ```
  constant    # Ο(1)
  logarithmic # Ο(log n)
  linear      # Ο(n)
  n log n .   # Ο(n log n)
  quadratic   # Ο(n2)

- list , array
- tuple
- set
- dictory
- stack

- graph
- greedy
  ```
  * Most networking algorithms use the greedy approach
  generally greedy algorithms do not provide globally optimized solutions.

- divide and conquer (Divide/Break, Conquer/Solve, Merge/Combine)
  ```
  *** based on divide-and-conquer 
  Merge Sort
  Quick Sort
  Binary Search

- dynamic programming 
  ```
  In contrast to greedy algorithms, where local optimization is addressed, dynamic algorithms 
  are motivated for an overall optimization of the problem.

  In contrast to divide and conquer algorithms, 
  where solutions are combined to achieve an overall solution,
  dynamic  algorithms use the output of a smaller sub-problem and 
  then try to optimize a bigger sub-problem. 
  Dynamic algorithms use Memoization to remember the output of already solved sub-problems.
