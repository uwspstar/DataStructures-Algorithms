### Python Interpreter (cpython)
- we're downloading a machine that takes our Python code which go hurry we're going to write. And it goes to the ```interpreter``` which we download using ```C Python``` and this C Python is going to create something called a ```byte code``` for example this byte code prints hello world on our screen.
- It's behind the scene. Now once it creates a byte code that is closer to machine code it then uses the ```C Python virtual machine```. Again just something that runs this code. And then this code gets run on our machine.
